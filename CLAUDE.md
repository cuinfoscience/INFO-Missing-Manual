# CLAUDE.md — Missing Manual for Information Scientists

This file guides Claude Code sessions working on this repository. Read it before making any changes.

---

## Project Overview

The **Missing Manual for Information Scientists** is a Quarto book for undergraduate non-CS majors — students in data science, social science, humanities, and adjacent fields who use computing as a tool but haven't learned the systematic practices that surround it. The handbook fills the "hidden curriculum" gap: the skills that fall between knowing what to type and understanding how to work professionally.

**Author:** Brian C. Keegan
**Format:** [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) rendered to HTML (primary) and PDF
**Intended use:** **Reference documentation**, not a front-to-back read. Each chapter is designed to stand on its own so a reader can drop in mid-book and still get value.

---

## How to Build

### Prerequisites

- **Quarto ≥ 1.9.0** (required for `llms-txt` support) — https://quarto.org/docs/download/
- **TinyTeX** (optional, local only) — only needed if you want to render the PDF; `quarto install tinytex`. CI builds HTML only.
- Optional: Python 3.11+ if you want to add executable code cells (not currently used)

### Commands

```bash
# Live preview (auto-rebuild on save)
quarto preview

# Render HTML (matches CI)
quarto render --to html

# Render PDF locally (requires TinyTeX, not run in CI)
quarto render --to pdf
```

Output lands in `book/` (gitignored). The landing page is `book/index.html`. The LLM-friendly files are `book/llms.txt` and one `*.llms.md` per chapter. A PDF is only produced if you explicitly run `--to pdf`.

### Verify

After `quarto render --to html`:

- **Zero warnings** from `quarto render --to html`.
- `book/index.html` opens and the sidebar lists all seven parts with their chapters.
- `book/llms.txt` exists and enumerates all chapters.
- At least a handful of `@sec-*` cross-references resolve (click through in HTML).
- Optional, local only: `quarto render --to pdf` renders without LaTeX errors (requires TinyTeX).

**Naming rules:**

- Directory slugs: lowercase, hyphens, `part-N-<topic>` (no spaces, no uppercase).
- Chapter file slugs: lowercase, hyphens (`virtual-environments.qmd`, not `virtual_environments.qmd` — underscores collide with Quarto's section-ID syntax).
- Section IDs: `{#sec-<slug>}`, matching the chapter file name without the extension.

---

## Section Labels (for `@sec-*` cross-references)

Every chapter has an explicit H1 section ID immediately after the heading. Use them in other chapters with `@sec-<name>`.

| Chapter | Label |
|---|---|
| Asking Technical Questions | `@sec-asking-questions` |
| Technical Documentation | `@sec-documentation` |
| Common Text Formats | `@sec-common-formats` |
| Reading Official Documentation | `@sec-reading-docs` |
| Debugging | `@sec-debugging` |
| Reading Python Tracebacks | `@sec-tracebacks` |
| Artifacts Have Politics | `@sec-artifacts-politics` |
| Operating System | `@sec-os-management` |
| Local File System | `@sec-filesystem` |
| Command Line | `@sec-terminal` |
| Text Editors | `@sec-text-editors` |
| Remote Computing | `@sec-remote-computing` |
| Package Management | `@sec-pkg-mgmt` |
| Virtual Environments | `@sec-virtual-environments` |
| Jupyter | `@sec-jupyter` |
| Scripting | `@sec-scripts-vs-notebooks` |
| Regular Expressions | `@sec-regex` |
| Code Style, Linting, and Formatting | `@sec-linting` |
| Data File Formats | `@sec-data-file-formats` |
| Tabular Data: Shape, Cleaning, and Validation | `@sec-tabular-data` |
| pandas Basics | `@sec-pandas-basics` |
| SQL Basics | `@sec-sql-basics` |
| HTTP and Web APIs | `@sec-http-apis` |
| How to Read Scholarly Articles and Books | `@sec-reading-scholarship` |
| How to Write Scholarly Manuscripts | `@sec-writing-manuscripts` |
| How to Write a Thesis | `@sec-writing-thesis` |
| How to Present | `@sec-presenting` |
| How to Use LaTeX | `@sec-latex` |
| Project Management | `@sec-project-management` |
| Version Control | `@sec-git-github` |
| Collaboration Mechanics | `@sec-collaboration` |
| Automation | `@sec-automation` |
| Environment Variables and Secrets | `@sec-secrets` |
| Using AI Tools | `@sec-ai-llm` |
| LLM Internals | `@sec-llm-internals` |
| AI Agents | `@sec-ai-agents` |
| Evaluating AI | `@sec-evaluating-ai` |
| Glossary (appendix) | `@sec-glossary` |
| AI Disclosure (appendix) | `@sec-ai-disclosure` |

**Inline reference form:**

```markdown
See @sec-debugging for the investigative loop.
```

Quarto auto-prefixes `Chapter` when rendering, so do **not** write "Chapter @sec-debugging" — it becomes "Chapter Chapter 4 Debugging."

## Style Guide

### Tone and Voice

- **Friendly guide** — warm, second-person, like a knowledgeable senior colleague.
- Always address the reader as **"you"** (not "the user," "the student," "one," or "a reader").
- Empathetic about frustration; high expectations about capability.
- Direct and imperative for instructions: "Run this command," "Check the version."
- Non-judgmental about mistakes and questions.

### Canonical Chapter Structure

Every content chapter follows this structure:

1.  `# Chapter Title {#sec-<slug>}` (H1 with explicit section ID)
2.  **Prerequisites callout** (top of chapter, `::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}`)
3.  `## Purpose {.unnumbered}` — one to three paragraphs explaining why this chapter exists
4.  `## Learning objectives {.unnumbered}` — numbered list; intro is always *"By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:"*
5.  `## Running theme: <short phrase> {.unnumbered}` — one-sentence principle for the chapter
6.  Numbered `## Section` blocks — main content
7.  `## Worked examples` — numbered subsections
8.  `## Templates` — reusable snippets (optional, varies by chapter)
9.  `## Exercises` — numbered list
10. `## One-page checklist` — bullet list for quick reference
11. `## Quick reference: ...` — tables and one-liners (optional)

### Prerequisites and see-also callout (chapter independence)

Every content chapter begins with a collapsible callout that lists 0–3 prerequisite chapters and 0–3 related chapters. This is how we signal that each chapter is self-contained but linkable.

```markdown
::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Prerequisites and see-also

**Prerequisites (read first if unfamiliar):** @sec-foo, @sec-bar.

**See also:** @sec-baz, @sec-qux.
:::
```

Inline `(see @sec-foo)` references are also fine inside prose — the two mechanisms reinforce each other.

### Formatting Conventions

**Emphasis:**

```markdown
**bold first definitions**   <!-- bold for first mention of a term -->
*italic emphasis*            <!-- italic for concepts -->
`code`                       <!-- backticks for commands/filenames -->
```

**Lists:** plain markdown; no pandoc-style list options. Quarto respects list spacing automatically.

**Code blocks:** fenced blocks with a language hint where it helps highlighting.

````markdown
```bash
pip install pandas
```

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```
````

Non-executable code blocks are the default; the book does not currently use Jupyter/Python execution. If you add executable cells, use ` ```{python} ` and configure `execute: enabled: true`.

**Citations:**

```markdown
[@wilson2017goodenough]
[@wilson2017goodenough; @chacon2014progit]
```

Bibliography file: `references.bib` at the repo root. Bibliography rendering is handled automatically via `bibliography: references.bib` in `_quarto.yml`.

**Links and margin notes:**

```markdown
[link text](https://example.com)

^[A sidenote appears as a numbered margin note in HTML.]

::: {.column-margin}
![Caption.](graphics/figure.png){#fig-my-figure}
:::
```

**Callouts** (five flavors: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `important`, `caution`):

```markdown
::: {.callout-note}
A helpful note.
:::
```

**Cross-references:**

- Section: `## Topic {#sec-topic}` → `@sec-topic`
- Figure: `![Caption.](img.png){#fig-foo}` → `@fig-foo`
- Table: `| col |\n|---|\n| data |` with `: Caption {#tbl-foo}` → `@tbl-foo`

**Glossary links:**

```markdown
A [virtual environment](../appendix/appendix-glossary.qmd#term-virtual-environment) is...
```

Each glossary term in `appendix-glossary.qmd` has an explicit `{#term-<slug>}` anchor. Use these sparingly — link only on first use in a chapter.

### What Not to Change

- `_quarto.yml` top-level structure without a reason. In particular, do not remove the sibling `website: { llms-txt: true }` block; Quarto 1.9 has a bug where `llms-txt` under `book:` does not activate llms.txt generation, but under `website:` it does. See @sec-automation analog in the issue tracker if you want to upstream this.
- Section ID prefixes. They are baked into cross-references across the book.

## Common Tasks

### Add a new chapter

1.  Create a file at `parts/part-N-<topic>/<slug>.qmd`.
2.  Start the file with `# Chapter Title {#sec-<slug>}`.
3.  Add the Prerequisites callout template (copy from any existing chapter).
4.  Follow the canonical 8-section structure above.
5.  Register the chapter in `_quarto.yml` under the appropriate `part:`.
6.  If the chapter introduces new vocabulary, add glossary terms to `appendix-glossary.qmd`.
7.  Run `quarto preview` and verify the sidebar and cross-references work.

### Add a cross-reference

1.  Confirm the target chapter has a `{#sec-<slug>}` on its H1 (all current chapters do; see the label table above).
2.  Write `@sec-<slug>` in the source chapter. Quarto auto-prefixes "Chapter" on render.
3.  Run `quarto render` and confirm no `Unable to resolve crossref` warnings.

### Add a figure

1.  Place the PNG in `graphics/`.
2.  Reference it with:

    ```markdown
    ::: {.column-margin}
    ![Short descriptive caption.](graphics/filename.png){#fig-slug}
    :::
    ```

3.  Cross-reference it in prose with `@fig-slug`.

### Add a bibliography entry

1.  Add the BibTeX entry to `references.bib`.
2.  Cite with `[@key]` in the text.
3.  Quarto renders the full bibliography at the end of the book automatically.

## Gap Chapter Backlog

The handbook's original gap analysis identified 16 candidate chapters. The first round added three high-priority chapters that survived (`tracebacks`, `virtual-environments`, `data-file-formats`); a fourth, on testing with pytest, was drafted but later removed because the topic was outside the handbook's intended audience. The second round added eight more: `reading-docs`, `regex`, `linting`, `tabular-data`, `pandas-basics`, `sql-basics`, `http-apis`, and `secrets`. (Pre-commit hooks were originally drafted as a separate chapter, then condensed into a section of `automation.qmd` because the standalone treatment was too detailed for the intended audience.) The third round added `common-formats` (Markdown, YAML, JSON syntax) and moved `ai-llm` from Part I to the Algorithmic Systems part, where it sits alongside the other AI chapters. The fourth round added a new **Part V — Communication** with five chapters: `reading-scholarship`, `writing-manuscripts`, `writing-thesis`, `presenting`, and `latex`; this pushed Project Management to Part VI and Algorithmic Systems to Part VII. (Note: directory slugs `part-5-projects/` and `part-6-algorithmic/` retain their original names even though they now correspond to Parts VI and VII, to avoid breaking external links.) The fifth round folded four standing backlog items into existing chapters rather than creating new ones: a Stack Overflow section in `questions.qmd` (search-first habits, asking norms, what gets a question closed); a `wget`/`curl` section in `http-apis.qmd` (CLI fetches before Python, when to use which); a Docker / containers section in `virtual-environments.qmd` (when venvs are not enough, minimal Dockerfile, when *not* to reach for a container); and a substantially expanded shell-scripting section in `automation.qmd` covering `set -euo pipefail`, control flow, functions, exit-code conventions, and `trap`-based cleanup, with a short pointer from `terminal.qmd`. The following topics remain as candidates for future work.

**Carried over from earlier rounds:**

- **Data dictionary / schema docs** — new section in `project-management.qmd` covering column documentation and schema change tracking.
- **Profiling / performance (`%%timeit`, `cProfile`)** — add to `jupyter.qmd` or a new short chapter in Part III.

**Newly identified candidates:**

- **Reproducible randomness** — short section (likely in `pandas-basics.qmd` or `tabular-data.qmd`) on `np.random.default_rng(seed)`, why globals like `np.random.seed` are insufficient for parallel work, and how to thread a seed through a pipeline.
- **Cloud notebooks (Colab, Kaggle, Codespaces)** — add to `jupyter.qmd` or `remote.qmd`: what each platform is good for, how their environments differ from a local venv, and gotchas around persistence, secrets, and GPU access.
- **Out-of-memory data (chunked CSV, line-delimited JSON, Polars/DuckDB)** — extension of `data-file-formats.qmd`: when to graduate from `pd.read_csv` to chunking, streaming, or a different tool entirely.
- **Diagram literacy (Mermaid, ER, sequence)** — add to `documentation.qmd` or a new short chapter: how to read and produce ER diagrams, sequence diagrams, and architecture sketches as part of writing for technical audiences.
- **Interactive debuggers (`pdb`, IDE breakpoints)** — extend `debugging.qmd` with a section on stepping through code interactively rather than relying solely on print statements.
- **Editor automation (snippets, format-on-save, multi-cursor)** — extend `text-editors.qmd`: the keystrokes and configurations that turn an editor from a notepad into a tool.
- **Second-week Git (rebase, cherry-pick, reflog)** — extend `version-control.qmd` with the operations that show up in real collaboration once the basic add/commit/push loop is fluent.
- **Data ethics and licensing** — possible new chapter or section in `artifacts-have-politics.qmd` covering data licenses (CC-BY, ODbL, terms of use), citation of datasets, and the ethics of scraping vs. downloading from a published source.

Each of the above would be a reasonable first PR for a contributor. Follow the canonical 8-section structure (see Style Guide) and add the chapter to `_quarto.yml` + the label table above.

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/build-book.yml` renders the book on every push to `main` and on pull requests against `main`, using the latest stable Quarto release (`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2`). Pull requests run a render-only validation step (`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render@v2`) and do not publish. Pushes to `main` (and manual `workflow_dispatch` runs) render and publish the book to GitHub Pages via `quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2` with `target: gh-pages`.

The minimum Quarto version is 1.9.0 (`llms-txt` requires it). If you need to pin a specific version for reproducibility, set `version:` in the workflow's `setup@v2` step.
